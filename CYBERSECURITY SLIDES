CYBERSECURITY
What is Cybersecurity: Identifying cyber threats and securing computed networks, encryption of data

CYBER THREATS:
MALWARE: VIRUSES AND WORMS
	VIRUSES: requires user interaction to enter the device
	WORMS: enters the device via the server
DENIAL OF SERVICE (DOS):
	rendering a network, host

	packet: Conceptually, a network packet is like a postal package. In this scenario, the header is the box or envelope, the payload is content and the 	trailer is the signature. The header contains instructions related to the data in the packet. A packet is basically a part of the data being 	transferred

	TCP: The Transmission Control Protocol provides a communication service at an intermediate level between an application program and the Internet 	Protocol

	Vulnerability Attack: sending packets to a an os running on a targetted host, leading to the crash of the host

	Bandwidth Flooding: sending several packets to teh target host, that the host gets clogged and legitimate packets cannot be recieved

	Connection Flooding: establishing TCP's at the target host and the host then denies legitimate connections

	However, an upstream server can detect these attacks and block requests from that source before the host is attacked
	
DISTRIBUTED DOS (DDOS):
	attacker uses multiple sources and has each soruce blast requests at the host 
PACKET SNIFFER: 
	software which monitors the pakcets sent over TCP and LAN, and then later being analysed for sensitive data
	The Wireshark use exactly as a packet sniffer
	best way to combat packet sniffing is cryptography {encrypting your data}
IP SPOOFING: 
	its the same as Abibas and Poma, this involves injecting packets into the internet and masquarade as another user, for combatting this we'll need end-	point authentication
SQL INJECTION: Hackets manipulating an SQL {the language for accessing and manipulating databases} query {set of commands} in a database website
BRUTE FORCE: Trying out every combination of password, this work done easy by a quantum computer
